            <li>Bridge: A networking device in a computer network that is used to connect multiple LANs to a larger LAN. 
                In computer networks, we have multiple networking devices such as bridges, hubs, routers, switches,
                 etc, each device has its own specification and is used for a particular purpose.</li><br>
            <li>Switch: A piece of networking hardware that links multiple devices together on a network. 
                Switches are typically small, flat boxes that contain a group of Ethernet ports.</li><br>
            <li>Router: A device that connects two or more packet-switched networks or subnetworks. 
                It serves two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks by forwarding
                 data packets to their intended IP addresses, and allowing multiple devices to use the same 
                 Internet connection.</li><br>
            <li>Gateway: A hardware device that acts as a "gate" between two networks. It may be a router, firewall, 
                server, or another device that enables traffic to flow in and out of the network.</li>

                 multiple computers.</li><br>
            <li>Distributed System: A collection of autonomous computer systems that are physically separated but are connected 
                by a centralized computer network that is equipped with distributed system software.</li><br>
            <li>Cloud Computing: The on-demand availability of computing resources (such as storage and infrastructure), 
                as services over the internet. It eliminates the need for individuals and businesses to 
                self-manage physical resources themselves, and only pay for what they use.</li>

            <li>Tier 2:An Internet service provider which engages in the practice of peering with other networks,
                 but which also purchases IP transit to reach some portion of the Internet.</li><br>
            <li>Tier 3: An internet service provider that is closest to the end users and helps them to connect to the

                 domain name system.</li><br>
            <li>DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online
                 through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP)
                  addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.</li><br>
            <li>TLD: Top-Level DomainA top-level domain is one of the domains at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Name System
                 of the Internet after the root domain.[10] The top-level domain names are installed in the root zone
                  of the name space.</li><br>

                 FTP is considered an application layer protocol.</li><br>
            <li>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol is the protocol used to transfer data over the web. It is part of
                 the Internet protocol suite and defines commands and services used for transmitting webpage data.</li>
                 <br>

                It is also referred to as a web address. URLs consist of multiple parts -- including a protocol 
                and domain name -- that tell a web browser how and where to retrieve a resource.</li><br>
            <li>Client-Side Activities: A type of development that involves programs that run on a client's or user's device. Client-side
                 developers focus on creating the part of a website with which the user interacts.</li><br>
            <li>Server-Side Activities: A type of development that involves programs that run on a server. This type of programming is

            <li>Application Layer: An abstraction layer that specifies the shared communication protocols and interface methods used
                 by hosts in a communications network.[1] An application layer abstraction is specified in
                  both the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and the OSI model.</li><br>
            <li>Transport Layer: The fourth layer in the OSI model and the second layer in the TCP/IP model. 
                It provides with end to end connection between the source and the destination and reliable delivery
                 of the services.</li><br>
            <li>Network Layer: Considered the backbone of the OSI Model. It selects and manages the best logical path (virtual circuit)
                 for data transfer between nodes by assigning destination and source IP addresses to each data segment.</li>
                 <br>
            <li>Link Layer: The bottom-most of the three layers of our reference model. It's responsible for moving data directly
                 from one physical location to another. It thus gets involved in several distinct issues: 
                 physical transmission, framing bits and bit sequences, detecting transmission errors, 
                 multiplexing the link, and providing a useful interface to the network layer above.</li>

            <li>Packet-Switching Network: A method of transferring data to a network in form of packets. In order to transfer the file 
                fast and efficiently manner over the network and minimize the transmission latency, 
                the data is broken into small pieces of variable length, called Packet.</li><br>
            <li>Fault Tolerant: The ability of a system (computer, network, cloud cluster, etc.) to continue operating without
                 interruption when one or more of its components fail.</li><br>
            <li>Redundant: Data and system components that are numerous, parallel, duplicated or mirrored and are thus available
                 in abundance. Depending on the context, this can have both positive and negative connotations in IT.</li>

                 or destroy computers and computer systems.</li><br>
            <li>Virus: A type of malware that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs
                 and inserting its own code into those programs. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas
                  are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus, a metaphor derived from biological viruses.</li><br>
            <li>Worm: A type of malware whose primary function is to self-replicate and infect other computers while 
                remaining active on infected systems. A computer worm duplicates itself to 
                spread to uninfected computers.</li><br>
            <li>Trojan Horse: A type of malware that downloads onto a computer disguised as a legitimate program. 
                    The delivery method typically sees an attacker use social engineering to hide malicious
                     code within legitimate software to try and gain users' system access with their software.</li><br>
            <li>Spyware: Malicious software that enters a users computer, gathers data from the device and user, 
                and sends it to third parties without their consent. A commonly accepted spyware definition 
                is a strand of malware designed to access and damage a device without the users consent.</li><br>
            <li>Phising: A harmful individual, or group of individuals, that cheats users by sending emails or creating
                 web pages that are intended to collect an individual's online bank, credit card, or other 
                 login information.</li><br>
            <li>DDoS Attack: Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack is a cybercrime in which the attacker floods a server with
                 internet traffic to prevent users from accessing connected online services and sites.</li>

            <li>Firewall: A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic 
                based on predetermined security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted 
                network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.</li><br>
            <li>Spam Filter: A program used to detect unsolicited, unwanted and virus-infected emails and prevent those
                 messages from getting to a user's inbox. Like other types of filtering programs, a spam filter 
                 looks for specific criteria on which to base its judgments.</li><br>
            <li>Proxy Server: A system or router that provides a gateway between users and the internet. Therefore,
                 it helps prevent cyber attackers from entering a private network.</li><br>
            <li>Antivirus Software: A program(s) that is created to search, detect, prevent and remove software viruses from
                 your system that can harm your system.</li>
